      "PatientX.AI is a machine learning-powered system designed to surface shared experiences among patients and caregivers navigating neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia. By analyzing thousands of posts from online health forums, the platform identifies frequently discussed topics—ranging from early symptoms to caregiving challenges—helping illuminate the typical patient journey. These insights empower caregivers, healthcare professionals, and patients themselves with clear understanding of what to expect. By bridging the gap between lived experiences and clinical care, PatientX.AI enhances communication between communities and care providers. The system brings transparency to the healthcare journey, uncovering patterns that can inform both individual decision-making and broader resource planning.",

We improved the Ramanujan Machine BOINC infrastructure (a platform enabling users to donate idle computing resources to scientific research) to maximize the value of contributed computational power.

State-of-the-art approaches like Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) can greatly speed up these types of force field calculations by reducing communication overheads during simulation intervals. However, recent implementations of MPNN, such as MACE, are not fully available to GPU-enabled molecular dynamics simulations. This project focused on a collaborative profiling and porting effort starting with the PI's existing software library for calculations of inter-atomic force fields with MACE/MPNN optimizations, 'sprint C++'.

Because QCSchema models are deeply nested and widely reused across multiple software projects, the transition from Pydantic v1 to v2 was non-trivial—these APIs are incompatible and cannot be mixed—making an abrupt switch infeasible without risking disruption to the broader ecosystem. To resolve this, we separated v1 and v2 models into distinct namespaces within QCElemental, allowing users to import and use either version as needed. We also refactored the schema's internal structure to reduce redundancy and improve composability, transitioning from inheritance-heavy models to a cleaner, more modular design based on community planning. This required substantial changes to model definitions, the addition of version-aware conversion functions, and updates to QCEngine's internal execution paths to support both versions. Continuous integration tests were expanded to ensure parity and stability across the dual-version system.",

The new schema architecture is more composable, reusable, and intuitive, with clearer data organization and relationships between components. The diagram shows how the different modules and components of the schema interact with each other, providing a comprehensive view of the quantum chemistry data structure. By updating the schema expression from Pydantic v1 API to v2, we unblocked downstream projects that were dependent on these modernizations. The new structure makes it easier for quantum chemistry researchers to maintain and extend the schema, while maintaining backward compatibility with existing implementations.",

      "CoAuthor is an intelligent writing assistant designed to go beyond traditional autocomplete tools by recognizing and responding to user behavioral and cognitive patterns during the writing process. By analyzing how individuals write—such as pauses, edits, and revision styles—CoAuthor provides more personalized and context-aware writing support. In addition to assisting writers, CoAuthor serves as a research platform. It allows behavioral scientists and HCI researchers to define custom patterns of interest and specify corresponding interventions. This flexibility enables experiments on how different types of feedback affect the writing process, offering a new tool for studying cognitive behavior through digital text interaction.",
